    <h1>The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana</h1>
    <br>
    <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) has introduced a significant reform starting from the Kharif 2024 season by implementing a 12% penalty for insurance companies that delay claim settlements beyond the stipulated period.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;">This penalty is meant to ensure timely compensation to farmers, who will directly receive the interest for any delays. The move is aimed at addressing frequent complaints about slow claim processing, often caused by delays in state governments releasing their share of the premium subsidy.â€‹</p>
